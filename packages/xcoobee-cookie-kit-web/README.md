# XcooBee Cookie Kit

## What is the XCK

The objective of the XcooBee Cookie Kit (XCK) is to enable websites to manage their Cookie consent more effectively and with less annoyance to their users. The XCK can work in concert with the XcooBee network to improve overall management for users and businesses but that is not required. When the XCK works independently of XcooBee some management functionality will not be available.

The XCK makes it easy to plugin cookie consent into your website. It handles all user interaction to obtain consent and lets the website know which cookies can be used for each users while they visit your website. Similarly, your website can now be informed when users change their consent even when they are not visiting it.

THe XCK is one of the most transparent and frictionless ways to manage cookies on your site. It will not pop-up, in, or otherwise hinder the user experience when it is not needed. Yet, at the same time, it provides full compliance with European e-directives and related GDPR rules.

Website owners can easily react to data-requests and report on privacy related requests if needed via the XcooBee network.

The XCK does not require a XcooBee connection to work for your website. You will still have access to the majority of user consent gathering but will not have central insight and consent management.

The XCK is responsive and will adjust easily to different screens including mobile uses.

[Quickstart](#examples-of-script-tag) to get to `<script>` tag examples.


## Easy Cookie Classification

The XCK uses a classification system for cookies rather than listing each individual cookie with its origin. By putting cookies into logical groups the XCK removes the need for technical expertise to distinguish individual cookies. Users can make an easier decision based on the intended use of the cookie rather than the domain name or any other technical criteria.

The XcooBee classification system broadly places cookies into one of the following types:

- Required or Application Cookies
- Personalization Cookies
- Statistics Cookies
- Advertising and Marketing Cookies

For more information please visit [XcooBee Cookie Classification](https://www.xcoobee.com/docs/xcoobee-concepts/cookies/).


## Example Applications

We have included two example applications that make use of the XCK so you can see it in action yourself.

### Single Page Application

Our cafe application demonstrates the use of XCK in a single page application. You can unzip and deploy on a webserver like IIS or Apache. The files are located in `examples/cafe-spa.zip`. Review the `index.html` file for instructions/explanations.

### Sample Request/Response app based on NodeJs & Express

Our pizza application demonstrates the use of the XCK in a request/response based application. You can unzip and deploy it directly on your system. You will need nodejs installed on your system. Review the `README.md` file for instructions/explanations.


## How does this Work

### The Cookie

![the cookie](docs/assets/cookie.png)

The XCK displays a floating cookie icon on the screen in a corner of your choice. By clicking on the cookie icon, users open a popup consent dialog that allows them to interact with your site.

![showing XCK cookie popup](docs/assets/cookie_popup.png)

The XCK can automatically determine when a full consent dialog or just the cookie is needed. Thus, making the site visit more pleasant and frictionless.

When using the XCK you:

- a) first determine which cookies you are currently using on your site
- b) then select which XcooBee cookie type (classification) that best fits each cookie
- c) display to your site visitors the XCK consent dialog popup to ask for permission
- d) after obtaining consent for a type of cookie, set the cookies in that group for your user using either a handler or target url pattern

If the cookie consent is already obtained, the XCK will not display another popup. You can query the status via JavaScript to set the cookies again, or track this on the backend side if you're using Request/Response type application.

### Example walk through

Let's assume an example of a JSP driven shopping site that uses four cookies:

`a` You determine that you use the following four cookies on your site.

1. Your JSP session cookie
2. A user cookie to keep track of user's theme
3. A site statistics cookie from your webserver
4. A global statistics cookie from Google Analytics

`b` You classify the cookies into the following types

Application: JSP Session Cookie

Personalization: user cookie

Statistics: local webserver cookie & google analytics cookie

`c` You [initialize and render](#c-load-xcoobee-cookie-kit) the XCK script to display the user consent popup.

`d` User makes selection and clicks OK.

You set the needed cookies using a JavaScript handler process that gets invoked by the XCK.

### Cookie Pulses

The cookie kit uses a short cut evaluation method to check whether it has already obtained consent for cookies from the user. This streamlines the setting of cookies. When this is successful, the cookie icon that is placed into a designated corner, pulses in different colors to indicate a shortcut selection has occurred.

![green cookie pulse](docs/assets/green.png)

The green pulse indicates that the user has visited this site before and the site's cookie consent settings are known and can be reapplied.

![blue cookie pulse](docs/assets/blue.png)

The blue pulse indicates that though the user has not visited this site before, the user has set consent preferences for new sites which can be applied. This is only possible when user and website are XcooBee network members.

![yellow cookie pulse](docs/assets/yellow.png)

The yellow pulse indicates that the user has elected to participate in the XcooBee Crowd AI program for cookies. The XcooBee network will use a crowd based analysis and set the cookies based on feedback from website visitors. This is only possible when user and website are XcooBee network members.

![red cookie pulse](docs/assets/red.png)

The red pulse indicates that we do not have any information directly from the user. In such a case, the website owner can select to use the website preference for cookies instead of user preferences. This can only be done if website and user are located outside the EU.


## Install

You activate the XCK by embedding it into your site via `<script>` tags. In addition, during invocation you provide additional parameters to the script tag.

Some of these include:

- position of the icon button
- terms url
- cookie policy url
- expiration time for the widget
- text message
- cookie handling function
- site defaults
- target Url

When you subscribe to XcooBee you can also specify:

- your campaign reference
- company logo
- cssAutoLoad

A `campaignId` is needed for the XCK to communicate with XcooBee and allow management of consents. Please visit [XcooBee](https://www.xcoobee.com) if you need to create an account. Without it the XCK will work in offline mode.


## Modes of Operation

The XCK operates in two modes. One, in disconnected mode, where the XCK and your website interact directly without the use of XcooBee network. Two, in connected mode, where XCK interacts with the XcooBee network to allow companies to document and manage cookie consent while giving users additional tools to manage and simplify cookie handling.

In the following we explain how each mode works.

### Disconnected Mode

![diagram showing XCK in disconnected mode](docs/assets/offline.png)

In disconnected mode,
1. your web site loads and renders its content without setting cookies
2. loads the XCK with your parameters
3. the XCK handles user interaction for cookie consent
4. communicates back to your site which cookie types can be set.

Your site, then, sets the cookies according to user preferences.


### Connected Mode

![alt text](docs/assets/online.png "diagram showing XCK in connected mode")

Connected mode is similar in process with differences in each step to reflect additional tools:

In connected mode,

1. your web site loads and renders its content without setting cookies
2. loads the XCK with your parameters including your campaign references
3. the XCK handles user interaction for cookie consent. For XcooBee users the XCK transparently negotiates with your site based on user preferences. XcooBee users can surf sites with little interruption.
4. XCK communicates back to your site which cookie types can be set.

   Your site, then sets the cookies according to user preferences.

5. As site owner, you can review all managed cookie consent. Report on compliance issues, take action when users change their consent even when not visiting your site. Your site visitors (users) can actively manage cookie consent centrally, and transparently surf your site without annoying popups.


## How to Use the XcooBee Cookie Kit

This section explains how to use the XCK on your site.

### How to use Cookie Kit in Single Page Application (SPA)

When using a SPA you can specify a JavaScript handler that can receive the result of the user interaction for cookie consent. Thereafter you need to load the scripts and/or set the cookies directly based on the user's interaction.

Since this can change, you also need to be able to remove the cookies when users change their mind.

In both cases, the XCK will invoke your handler function after the user has completed their interaction with XCK.

XCK will call your JavaScript handler with a JavaScript object. The user preferences are enumerated in the argument.

Here is and example object.

```json
{
  "application": true,
  "usage": true,
  "statistics": false,
  "advertising": false
}
```

Thus the call signature will be: `handlerFunction(cookieObject)`.

For example if your handler function is named `cookieHandler` and the function argument object is named `userCookiePreferences` this would be the signature of your function:

```js
cookieHandler(userCookiePreferences);
```

Sample cookieHandler function:

```js
function cookieHandler(consentSettings) {
  if (consentSettings.application) {
    // set required cookies here
    // ...
  } else {
    // remove required cookie here
    // ...
  };

  if (consentSettings.usage) {
    // set user personalization cookies here
    // ...
  } else {
    // remove user personalization cookies here
    // ...
  };

  if (consentSettings.statistics) {
    // set site statistics gathering cookies here
    // ...
  } else {
    // remove site statistics gathering cookies here
    // ...
  };

  if (consentSettings.advertising) {
    // set advertising and marketing and tracking cookies here
    // ...
  } else {
    // remove advertising and marketing and tracking cookies here
    // ...
  };
}
```

See a more [fully developed example](#b-write-a-js-handler) later in this document.

### How to use Cookie Kit with Request/Response systems like PHP, JSP, .net, CFML etc.

The XCK can communicate users' grant and removal of consent for cookies to your site via webhook post (HTTP POST) as well. You will need a web accessible endpoint as defined by `targetUrl` that can process these messages and set/unset the cookies by cookie type.

However, depending on your situation you still might be able to handle all interactions inside JavaScript without reloads or calls to backend (see example below)

The HTTP POST will be using `CONTENT-TYPE` = `application/json`

The body content is a JSON object with the user selection of cookie types. Only the cookie types for which you have asked for consent will be included.

```json
{
  "time": "2018-10-31T16:40:28",
  "code": 200,
  "result": {
    "application": true,
    "usage": false,
    "statistics": true
  }
}
```

Where:

```
time => date of the decision in UTC
code => 200 for success
result => the JSON with information about cookie types
```

A sample process to handle cookie consent via a Request/Response and a `handler-page` pattern could look like this. Your `handler-page` is most likely a piece of code that will need to be included in all page rendering calls. You will also need to be able to call it independently.

1. Your system starts without any cookies
2. If no cookies are defined you invoke the XCK
3. The XCK gathers user consent and call the `handler-page` indentified in `targetUrl` parameter
4. `handler-page` saves user decision and flag that user has made decision
5. for each subsequent call, the `handler-page` checks that user decision is available and sets the cookie types

Your `handler-page` will probably employ this kind of logic

- determine whether this is a regular call (included) or call from XCK to save user decision
- if regular call
  - determine if we have user cookie type decision
    - if we do not have decision -> load XCK by inserting `<script>` tags into HTML to present cookie choice to user
    - if we have user-cookie-decision -> load cookies for each allowed type
- if called from XCK
  - save user-cookie-decision


### Example use with PHP page combined with Cookie Kit

In this example we assume that we have a website running PHP engine to render webpages. As part of this process the website will load the XCK to manage user consent. You are managing cookie creation via JavaScript.

The management process breaks into this flow:

a. PHP page writes the values for each of cookie types into HTML/Javascript stream

b. Include JS Handler Code (example below)

c. Load XCK


#### `a` Pipe PHP variables with script tags into HTML

In this example, we assume that you have JS `<script>` tags for all the cookies that you need to create and saved them to corresponding PHP variables in this manner:

```html
$cookie_scripts_application => the required application cookies, e.g.

for example:
<script>
  document.cookie = $cookieName;
</script>


$cookie_scripts_user => the user personalization cookies

for example:
<script>
  var favoriteColor=blue;
</script>


$cookie_scripts_statistics => the site statistics cookies

for example:
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script>
(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');

ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
</script>
<!-- End Google Analytics -->

$cookie_scripts_advertising => the site advertising cookies

for example:
<script
  src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44="
  crossorigin="anonymous">

```

You would output each of these be HTML encoding them, like so

```html
<script>
// define cookie script management scope in JS
var myCookieScripts = {};

// most likely we can set this directly since these would be required
myCookieScripts.application = "<?php echo htmlentities(preg_replace( "/\r|\n/", "", $cookie_scripts_application )); ?>";

myCookieScripts.user = "<?php echo htmlentities(preg_replace( "/\r|\n/", "", $cookie_scripts_user )); ?>";

myCookieScripts.statistics = "<?php echo htmlentities(preg_replace( "/\r|\n/", "", $cookie_scripts_statistics )); ?>";

myCookieScripts.advertising = "<?php echo htmlentities(preg_replace( "/\r|\n/", "", $cookie_scripts_advertising )); ?>";
</script>
```

#### `b` write a JS Handler

You need to define your handler in JS. We are including a few helper functions that will actually set your cookies and load your scripts.

```js
  /**
   * parse html encoded script directives
   * @param {array} loadScripts - The array of scripts to be loaded
   * @return {object} the fully parsed html elements
   */
  function xckParseHtml(htmlData) {
    //parse encoded via text area
    var txt = document.createElement("textarea");
    txt.innerHTML = htmlData;

    // now add this as html to our mirror doc
    var el=document.createElement("html");
    el.innerHTML = txt.innerText;
    return el;
  }

  /**
   * Load Javascript. Can load from remote file or code.
   * @param {object} loadScripts - The HTMLCollection of scripts to be loaded
   */
  function xckLoadJs(loadScripts) {
    var i = 0;
    if (loadScripts.length > 0){
      for (i = 0; i < loadScripts.length; i++) {
        var item = loadScripts[i];
        var script = document.createElement("script");

        if (item.src === "") {
          script.text = item.text;
        } else {
          // load from file
          script.async = true; // we always load async
          script.src = item.src;
          script.onload = function () {
            console.log(`cookie script from ${item.src} is ready!`);
          };

          // other elements
          if (item.integrity !== "") {
            script.integrity = item.integrity;
          }
          if (item.crossOrigin !== "") {
            script.crossOrigin = item.crossOrigin;
          }
        }

        // now append to document for execution
        document.body.appendChild(script);
      }
    }
  }

  /**
   * This will be invoked by XCK when user clicks OK button
   * @param {object} consentSettings - The collection containing user decisions
   */
  function myCookieHandler(consentSettings) {
    // parse cookie scripts passed from PHP

    if (consentSettings.application) {
      // parse cookie scripts passed from PHP
      let myEl = xckParseHtml(myCookieScripts.application);
      let appScripts = myEl.getElementsByTagName("script");
      // set required cookies here
      xckLoadJs(appScripts);
    } else {
      // remove required cookie here
      // ...
    };

    if (consentSettings.usage) {
      // parse cookie scripts passed from PHP
      let myEl = xckParseHtml(myCookieScripts.user);
      let userScripts = myEl.getElementsByTagName("script");
      // set required cookies here
      xckLoadJs(userScripts);
    } else {
      // remove user personalization cookies here
      // ...
    };

    if (consentSettings.statistics) {
      // parse cookie scripts passed from PHP
      let myEl = xckParseHtml(myCookieScripts.statistics);
      let statScripts = myEl.getElementsByTagName("script");
      // set required cookies here
      xckLoadJs(statScripts);
    } else {
      // remove site statistics gathering cookies here
      // ...
    };

    if (consentSettings.advertising) {
      // parse cookie scripts passed from PHP
      let myEl = xckParseHtml(myCookieScripts.advertising);
      let adsScripts = myEl.getElementsByTagName("script");
      // set required cookies here
      xckLoadJs(adsScripts);
    } else {
      // remove advertising and marketing and tracking cookies here
      // ...
    };
  }
```

#### `c` Load XcooBee Cookie Kit

As outlined in a few areas, when you wish to start the XCK dialog, include the `<script>` tags in your HTML stream.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.3.3/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script id="xcoobee-cookie-kit" src="https://app.xcoobee.net/scripts/kit/xcoobee-cookie-kit.min.js"></script>
<script>
  XcooBee.kit.initialize({
    checkByDefaultTypes: ["application"],
    cookieHandler: "myCookieHandler",
    position: "right_bottom",
    privacyUrl: "http://mysite.com/privacy",
    requestDataTypes: ["application", "usage", "statistics"],
    termsUrl: "http://mysite.com/terms",
    textMessage: "Welcome to our shopping site. We use cookies to deliver a better service to you. Please let us know if this is OK."
  });
  XcooBee.kit.render();
</script>
```

### How to use the XCK with XcooBee subscription and high security data exchange

When you have a XcooBee subscription your website can also receive updates regarding the granted consent when the user is not directly online via the XcooBee network. This communication will occur through webhooks and higher level of encryption.

As an alternative to direct HTTP POST, your subscription to the XcooBee network also allows event polling so you can use the XCK for sites that are not directly accessible via the internet, i.e. intranet sites or sites under development.

You need to be able to process messages from XcooBee that are using PGP encryption on top of HTTPS/TLS.
The message pattern is the same as described previous section.

You can use one of the XcooBee SDKs for simplifying this interaction:

- [XcooBee JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/XcooBee/xcoobee-js-sdk)
- [XcooBee PHP SDK](https://github.com/XcooBee/xcoobee-php-sdk)

The use of the XcooBee network is not a required interaction. Users will transparently update their cookie preferences with your site every time they visit.


## Full Parameter Reference

The XCK is initialized with a set of parameters that determine the behavior of the XCK on your site. This can include rendering location, timeouts, event handlers, css etc.

The following is a list of parameters the XCK can process:

### checkByDefaultTypes `array`

This is an array of strings of cookie types used on your sites by default. This is one or more of [application|usage|statistics|advertising]. The default is empty array.

Example:

```js
checkByDefaultTypes: ["application"]
```

### cookieHandler `string` or `function`

If you are using a single page application or a JavaScript based solution for setting cookies you need to specify a cookie handler function, e.g.  `handleCookies(<object>)`. The XCK will call this function with the user's preferences or defaults as needed. This function should either remove or set the cookies based on the categories allowed by user.

This is related to `targetUrl`. One of `cookieHandler` or `targetUrl` is required to be specified for XCK to start.

See more information in section [`How to Use the XcooBee Cookie Kit`](#how-to-use-the-xcoobee-cookie-kit) in this document.

```js
cookieHandler: handleCookies
```

### displayOnlyForEU `boolean`

This lets the XCK know to do quick evaluation of the call context for the XCK if the users are outside the EU. If the XCK determines that it is being loaded outside the EU (28 nation block) and there are no user defaults or other guidance, the XCK can automatically apply company standard cookies using the `checkByDefaultTypes` setting. When doing so it will inform the user by pulsing red. The visiting user can still change the decisions at any time. Default is: false.


### expirationTime `integer`

This is the time in seconds we will display the floating cookie icon. After the expiration time has been reached the floating cookie icon will be removed from display. This time resets every time the icon is clicked and a popup dialog is displayed.

When set to zero, the icon will not be removed.

Defaults to zero.

```js
expirationTime: 0
```

### hideOnComplete `boolean`

The XCK can be completely hidden once the user has made the cookie type selection or the selection can be automatically determined. To enable the immediate removal of the cookie icon set this to true. Default: false

```js
hideOnComplete: true
```

### position `string`

The position parameter is one of [left_bottom|left_top|right_bottom|right_top] and indicates the position from which the XCK displays its window or floating cookie icon. Default: left_bottom

```js
position: "left_bottom"
```

### privacyUrl `string` `required`

This is the page the user will be directed to to review your Privacy Policy. The cookie kit will not start without data for Privacy Policy.

```js
privacyUrl: "https://mysite.com/privacy"
```

### requestDataTypes `array`

This is an array of strings of cookie types used on your sites for which you wish to obtain the users' consent before creating. This is one or more of [application|usage|statistics|advertising]. The default is `application`.

```js
requestDataTypes: ["application"]
```

### targetUrl `string`

If you are using Request/Response technology based site, for example PHP, JSP, CFML and you set the cookies in your code, the XCK will make a call via HTTP POST to the targetUrl you specify and a body parameter with JSON payload with the user's preferences for cookies.

Example Body Payload:

```json
{
  "time": "2018-10-11T15:40:28",
  "code": 200,
  "result": {
    "application": true,
    "usage": false,
    "statistics": false
  }
}
```

You will, then, need to set cookies by cookie type accordingly. We encourage the use of HTTPS/TLS connections to ensure proper security.

This is related to `cookieHandler`. One of `cookieHandler` or `targetUrl` is required to be specified for XCK to start.

See more information in section [`How to Use the XcooBee Cookie Kit`](#how-to-use-the-xcoobee-cookie-kit) in this document.

```js
targetUrl: "https://mysite.com/setCookies"
```

### termsUrl `string` `required`

This is the page the user will be directed to to review your Terms of Service. The cookie kit will not start without valid terms of service.

```js
termsUrl: "https://mysite.com/terms"
```

### testMode `boolean`

The XCK can run in test mode. When it does it will display a small `reset` button under the main floating cookie. You can use it to clear the local data store. This speeds up development tasks as you do not need to clear data manually or open/close private browser windows. Default: false

```js
testMode: true
```

### textMessage `string` `required`

This is the message we will display to the user when asking for cookie preferences. This message can be formatted as string or as JSON. When using JSON you can specify the message in different languages. The XCK will make an attempt to determine the default language based on browser settings and fallback to US English if it cannot make a determination. The cookie kit will not start without a consent message to display to users.

Example of text entry in single language:

```js
textMessage: "This site uses cookies. Please select the cookie types that you wish to use and then click OK"
```

Example of text entry in multiple languages:

```js
{
  "en-us": "English text",
  "de-de": "German text",
  "es-419": "Spanish text",
  "fr-fr": "French text",
}
```


## Initialization Parameters with XcooBee Subscription

### campaignReference

This connects your campaignId to the XCK. The XcooBee campaign wizard will generate it for you.

### companyLogo

The XCK can display your company logo. Your cookie campaign options will have the ability to upload a logo and will make available to the XCK.
This parameter is only available when subscripting to XcooBee.

### CSS override

If you wish to use your own CSS, the XcooBee code generator will set this based on your selection for your Cookie Campaign. Your campaign wizard will guide you through the process.

**IMPORTANT**

Your campaign name in the XcooBee campaign console needs to match your domain name (first part of the URL) for which you are using the cookie kit. If this is not the case, you will have errors returned from the XcooBee network.

For example if your site runs on this url "http://www.mysite.com/product/hello" the domain is `www.mysite.com`. This has to be your campaign name in XcooBee.


## Program Hooks

You can use public methods of the XCK to set and retrieve parameter information. These are found under the `XcooBee.kit` object.

### setParam([parameter], [value])

Use the `setParam()` method to set any valid parameter for the XCK. For example to set the `targetUrl` parameter to a different value. Where `parameter [string]` is any of the valid parameters, and `value [any]` is data for the parameter.

```js
XcooBee.kit.setParam("targetUrl", "https://newsite.com/cookieProcessor");
```

If you are using a `cookieHandler` JavaScript function that is not exposed in global scope, you will need to let the XCK know via a `setParam` call. You should do this after loading the XCK but before calling `XcooBee.kit.initialize()`.

```js
XcooBee.kit.setParam("cookieHandler", myCookieHandlerFunction);
```

Alternately, you can initialize with correct function reference.

```HTML
<script>
  XcooBee.kit.initialize({
    requestDataTypes: ["application", "usage"],
    checkByDefaultTypes: ["application"],
    cookieHandler: myCookieHandlerFunction,
   ...
  });
</script>
```

This can be useful when you wish to turn off certain function during runtime, e.g. the `hideOnComplete` param can be used to hide the XCK after user has confirmed cookie selection.

### getParam([parameter]) `object`

Retrieves the value of actively used parameter from the XCK.

Example:

```js
let termsSite = XcooBee.kit.getParam("termsUrl");
```

### getConsentStatus() `string`

Returns the current status of the XCK interaction with the user. Current this is one of [open|complete|closed].

`open` => user is being asked for consent at the moment

`complete` => we have received consent information from user

`closed` => the user did not respond and the cookie consent has expired after `expirationTime`


```js
let consentStatus = XcooBee.kit.getConsentStatus();
```

### getCookieTypes() `object`

This returns the users' decision regarding the consent for each cookie type. It will always return a full object with all types or empty object `{}`.
Only available after `getConsentStatus() = "complete"` If you call this before we have an answer from user we will return an empty object.

Example call:

```js
let cookieTypes = XcooBee.kit.getCookieTypes();
```

Example return object:

```json
{
  "application": true,
  "usage": true,
  "statistics": false,
  "advertising": false

## Examples of script tag

You will embed/install the XCK via added a script tag to your site. Here is an example of what this could look like.

You need to place this in the HTML of your site in between `<head>` and `<body>` tags. We suggest this as last script element.


```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.3.3/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script id="xcoobee-cookie-kit" src="https://app.xcoobee.net/scripts/kit/xcoobee-cookie-kit.min.js"></script>
<script>
  XcooBee.kit.initialize({
    requestDataTypes: ["application", "usage"],
    checkByDefaultTypes: ["application"],
    cookieHandler: myCookieHandler,
    expirationTime: 0,
    position: "left_bottom",
    privacyUrl: "https://mysite.com/privacy",
    termsUrl: "https://mysite.com/terms",
    textMessage: "This site uses cookies to make your experience better. Please let us know which type of cookies we may use."
  });
  XcooBee.kit.render();
</script>
```

Here is an example of parameters and values types for the initialization:

```html
<script id="xcoobee-cookie-kit" src="{URL}/scripts/kit/xcoobee-cookie-kit.min.js"></script>
<script>
  XcooBee.kit.initialize({
    campaignReference: <String>,
    checkByDefaultTypes: <Array>[application|usage|statistics|advertising]
    cookieHandler: <Function>,
    expirationTime: <Number> (in seconds),
    position: <String> ("left_bottom", "left_top", "right_bottom", "right_top"),
    privacyUrl: <String>,
    requestDataTypes: <Array>[application|usage|statistics|advertising],
    targetUrl: <String>,
    termsUrl: <String>,
    testMode: <Boolean>,
    textMessage: <String>, <Object>
  });
  XcooBee.kit.render();
</script>
```
